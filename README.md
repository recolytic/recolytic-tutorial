### 3- SIMULATION: COLLECT / RECOMMEND / UPTAKE

For this simulation we assume that we are an ecommerce web site, we have a **langing page**, **product page**, "shopping cart" page* and *checkout page**.


Now launch a command line, go to the **recolytic-tutorial** folder, launch the batch **simulate.sh**. This batch will execute 3 main tasks:


+ Simulate uers actions: This script will simulate 7 users actions (more details can be found reading the comments in **simlate.sh** file)
+ Issue recommendations: 5 recommendations strategies are called by the script:
	+ **landing page** we deployed the **most popular** and the **recently visied** recommendation strategy.
	+ **product page** we are calling the **item to item** strategy. 
	+ For the **shopping cart** we are using **co-occurence**  and **user to user** recommendations strategies.
+ Simlate uptakes: We are simulating that the user click on a item that was recommended to it.


### 4- ANALYSE: RECOLYTIC CONSOLE

Now sign in to recolytic administration console, select the subscription "Tutorial", Under **Insights**:

+ To determine the performance of an integrated recommendation strategy for a given page, select **Strategies performance**.
